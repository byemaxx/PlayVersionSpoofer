# PlaySpoofer
[‰∏≠Êñá](README_zh.md) | [English](README.md)

An Xposed module that modifies Google Play Store version information.

## üöÄ Features

This module spoofs the Google Play Store version information to:
- **Version Code**: 99999999  
- **Version Name**: "999.999.999"

This prevents the Google Play Store from automatically updating itself.

## üîç How to Verify PlaySpoofer is Working

1. Open the Google Play Store
2. Tap the profile icon in the top-right corner
3. Select "Settings" from the menu
4. Scroll down to find the "About" section
5. Verify that the version code and name match the spoofed values

</p>

> **üìù Note**: The version spoofing only affects the version information displayed within the Google Play Store app itself. If you check the version from external sources (such as device Settings > Apps), it will still show the original values.

## üìã Requirements

- Rooted Android device
- Xposed Framework (LSPosed recommended)
- Android 9.0+

1. Download and install the APK file from [Releases](https://github.com/byemaxx/PlayVersionSpoofer/releases)
2. Enable the module in your LSPosed manager
3. Select "Google Play Store" as the target scope
4. Open the PlaySpoofer app to verify activation status
